# simpleshooter
Simple shooter made with UE4 and C++

It uses the ParagonWraith and the Modular SciFi Season 1 assets from the Epic Free Content.
It was made following one of GameDev.tv's courses but it has some extras and personal touches.


I plan to pick this up again to work on some procedurally generated maps. But it's still a work in progress that I'll postpone for now.
